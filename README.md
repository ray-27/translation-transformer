## Introduction
This repository contains a custom-designed Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model built from scratch using PyTorch. It leverages the advanced transformer architecture to translate English text into Hindi, focusing on achieving high accuracy and robustness in translation tasks.

## Features
- **Custom Transformer Architecture**: Fully implemented transformer components including multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks.
- **Advanced Optimization Techniques**: Utilizes layer normalization and dropout to enhance model stability and convergence.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient management and preprocessing of large datasets with tokenization and embedding techniques.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses BLEU scores for rigorous testing and validation, ensuring the model's effectiveness and reliability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and reports are provided to elucidate the development process and results.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
